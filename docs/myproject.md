# My Project

This summer my project focused on the use of AI like Chat GPT in a data science field. I focused on being able to use Chat GPT to evaluate epedemic related datasets such as the first cases of COVID-19 and ____. By using Chat GPT I was able to create a python code that can evaluate any set of data that includes a longitude and lattitude and create a heatmap from it. The aim of this project was to implement the common and ethical use of AI such as Chat GPT in data science while also creating more open and acessable science such as heatmaps.
