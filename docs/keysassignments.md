## Assignment 1: Internship Description 


#### Project Description

This summer, I have the privilege of working in Dr. Swetnam's lab, delving into the fascinating intersection of AI and scientific research. Dr. Swetnam, a Research Associate Professor of Geoinformatics and Joint faculty member in the School of Natural Resources and Environment, is actively involved in the CyVerse initiative, which promotes open science. Among his various projects, he is currently exploring the applications of AI in scientific fields. My specific focus this summer revolves around the utilization of AI tools such as Chat GPT and Google Bard to examine their impact on data analysis in the context of epidemic-related data (e.g., Covid-19, Cholera). The goal is to develop a reusable Python code that can effectively generate heat maps for hotspot mapping. By addressing the transformative influence of AI on scientific endeavors, we aim to foster a more accessible and collaborative scientific community. In essence, this research journey embraces the promising prospects of AI, forging new paths in scientific inquiry while cultivating a more inclusive approach to knowledge discovery.
